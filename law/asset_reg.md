# Governance of a global market place

## Governance versus Regulation

Bitcoin is mostly a currency, but also potentially a contract and asset transfer system. When
the technology- and financial industry gets excited about "blockchain", what they really mean
is mostly the ability to transfer assets. However, there is no alignment among jurisdictions what assets,
property and contracts are. In particular transfer of property through exchanges ("marketplaces")
is also heterogenous. Regulation, self-regulation and governance should be carefully distinguished.
Regulation often implies a top-down process of nation states and large corporations dictating the state of
affairs (how likely is a citizen to affect global banking regulations or monetary policy?). Self-regulation and governance are a bottom up process of engagement.

## Regulation of cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are regulated differently by each jurisdiction. From 193 UN members 70 countries have issued a guidance on regulation according to http://merkletree.io , 80% of which are friendly (Permissive 58, Contentious 9, Hostile 3, total 70).

One of the most difficult questions around Bitcoin is its regulation as money versus its regulation as an asset. For most purposes now in the developed world Bitcoin can be treated as money in the sense that its VAT tax exempt. It seems likely that it will take a significant time before Cryptosecurities will become regulated as assets. Ethereum was the first project which sought regulation as a legal crowdsale of its token (see [1]), in cooperation with the Swiss government (Self-regulation via SRO's). See also the website of Digital Finance Compliance Association [2].

## Regulation of Bitcoin exchanges

Almost all exchanges are regulated without a legal exchange framework, except those in the US. Gemini has pursued extensive regulation within the NY state. There are no laws for Bitcoin exchanges themselves. Effectively banks make the laws by what business they accept.

## Regulation of Exchanges

Exchange laws have a long history and are very different around the world, also depending on the asset class. The World federation of exchanges has the important exchanges under one umbrella [3], but most laws and rules that affect markets are determined by mostly governments and partially supra-governmental entities: definition of assets, definition of property, everything that applies to transfer of property and breaches of it, what counts as permissible trade, regulation of corporations, tax of profit, and so on.

For a history of electronic markets and Alternative Trading venues in the US I'd recommend the book by Scott Patterson: Dark Pools: The Rise of the Machine Traders and the Rigging of the U.S. Stock Market. When the SEC allowed for Alternative Trading Systems (ATS), Island was launched as an electronic matching venue.

The European Union has regulated exchanges and alternative trading venues under MiFID Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, see [4], [5].
